Cavemen had paintings, I have a blog. 

"Github":http://github.com, "webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org, and
"app engine":http://appengine.google.com are my charcoal, wooden clubs
and dwelling. They're the backbone of this blog.

And yes, it's an unusual combination of technologies. It's not confusing
though. Each of these technologies support my real tools:

* Source Control
** Technology is brittle. I break things all the time. Any good
technologist does. Great technologists know how to get out of these
jams. Effective source control usage makes me seem like a great
technologist, so I try to practice it all the time.

* Code Generation
** Without it, this site simply wouldn't exist. I don't have the time
or inclination to author and maintain a mountain of html.

* Free Hosting
** All this stuff cost a lot of money. This wouldn't exist if it had to
come out of my pocket. It also wouldn't exist if I wasn't able to fiddle
with the underlying technologies.

Are you banging rocks together? Or do you have tools?
