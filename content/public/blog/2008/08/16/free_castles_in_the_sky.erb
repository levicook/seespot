I'm reading ??Deploying Rails Applications??. The authors use a lot
of metaphors. I don't identify with all of them, but do like one in
particular. Paraphrasing, it goes something like this: 

bq. Finding a host for your Rails application, is like finding a home.

It extends nicely...

Many people start in a dorm, or an apartment with several roommates. Rails
apps frequently begin production life on a shared host. The financial
constraints are comparable. The downsides of sharing are comparable...

If all goes well, you start making money, get sick of sharing and find
your own apartment (or VPS). When you finally "make it big", you end up
living in a beautiful[1] castle.

On a personal level, I believe I'm pretty good at deployment. I wonder
if it's because I moved around a lot when I was younger, and became good
at that.

Another angle to consider, is Google's App Engine. Within the current
metaphor, they're handing out free castles. As a former Python bigot,
it's pretty exciting. It'll be interesting to see what happens as their
beta status matures, and they extend their feature set. 


fn1. Okay, you might have to be an engineer, to find server clusters
beautiful.
