h2. Objective

To develop world class software, on a world class team, using modern
technologies and effective practices. I want to collaborate on
architecture and design decisions with a team of talented developers
in an non-hierarchical environment. I want to work closely with
project sponsors and end users.


h2. Profile

I've been developing medium and large scale software systems since
1997. I value personal collaboration, and take a hands-on, low
ceremony approach to planning and construction. I have expert
knowledge of Object Oriented (OO) analysis, design and implementation.
I'm deeply committed to effective source control, testing and
deployment practices. My work is heavily influenced by Agile methods,
Open Source Software and Usability.
